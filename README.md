# Pokedex

[![Run RSpec tests](https://github.com/4e4c52/Pokedex/actions/workflows/rspec.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/4e4c52/Pokedex/actions/workflows/rspec.yml)

This Rails 7 app provides an API to access a subset of the Pokemon data available from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2).

## Installation

Just run `bundle install` inside the projet.

Then create the database with `bundle exec rails db:setup`.

SQLite is used in development and PostgreSQL in production.

## Development

You can either start the app with `bundle exec rails s` or using the _Procfile.dev_ file with a tool such as [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) or [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman).

## Updating the database

To update the data, just run the following rake tasks:

```bash
bundle exec rake import:types
bundle exec rake import:pokemons
```

## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated by Swagger and available on [the website](https://pokedex-4e4c52.herokuapp.com/api-docs).

You can regenerate it with `bundle exec rake rswag:specs:swaggerize`.
